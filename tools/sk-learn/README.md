I have tried to explore different models in scikit-learn, learned about their working and how to use them. I have also tried to implement them on different datasets to see how they perform.
I have also used other libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc. to preprocess the data and visualize it.

The normal workflow that I have followed is:

1. Load the dataset
2. Preprocess the data
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate the model
6. Make predictions
7. Visualize the results
8. Repeat the process for different models
9. Compare the results and choose the best model

The content of this directory is as follows:

0. A end-to-end sklearn workflow
1. Getting the data ready
2. Choose the right estimator/algorithm for our problems
3. Fit the model/algorithm and use it to make predictions on our data
4. Evaluating a model
5. Improve a model
6. Save and load a trained model
7. Putting it all together

These are the following notebooks that I have created, it contains in depth exploration based on the above workflow:

1. [Basic Workflow](./basic-workflow.ipynb) -  Basic workflow of using scikit-learn. It contains the steps mentioned above.
2. [Data Preprocessing](./data-processing.ipynb) -  Cleaning and preprocessing the data using pandas and numpy (along with sklean).
3. [Models](./models.ipynb) -  Implementation of different models in scikit-learn.
4. [Fit and Predict](./fit-and-predict.ipynb) -  Fitting the model and making predictions.
5. [Evaluating Models](./model-evaluation.ipynb) -  Evaluating the models using different metrics.
