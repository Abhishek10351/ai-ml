Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n",

    "### 1. Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data. You provide the algorithm with a dataset that includes both the input and the correct output. The algorithm learns on this dataset and then is tested on a new dataset. The algorithm makes predictions based on the examples it learned from.\n",
    "Ex - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, the algorithm learns from data that has not been labeled, classified, or categorized. The algorithm tries to learn the patterns from the data and then group the data based on the patterns.\n",
    "Ex - K-means, Hierarchical clustering, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that allows the agent to decide the best next action based on its current state, by learning behaviors that will maximize the reward.\n"
